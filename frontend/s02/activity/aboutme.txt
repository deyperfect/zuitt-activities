Name: Edryl Palinis 
Nickname: Ed

	I started to learn on my own for the past few weeks, however, but studying alone quickly became challenging and boring. That led me to look for communities and platforms that could help me learn with other people. When I heard of this bootcamp, I immediately decided that I'll be joining to experience collaboration with real people while doing and solving actual projects.

	I've spent the past few years working in compliance, quality assurance, and customer support roles. A big part of my career involved investigation, research, and handling of sensitive information. Over time, I developed skills that are more relevant in the tech industry and became more interested in building systems that allow me to work efficiently. After experiencing different roles, I've finally decided to chase my personal dream of doing something I truly want for myself.
